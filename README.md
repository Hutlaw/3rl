# 3rl

**3rl** stands for **3 Random Letters**. This repository is a simple automation that pushes an image containing a specified set of random letters (three, four, or five) to Bluesky accounts approximately three times every hour.

## What It Does

Every few minutes, the system:
- Generates an image featuring a random combination of letters (either three, four, or five characters long).
- Pushes this image to the corresponding Bluesky account.

This lightweight process keeps the profiles fresh with a new, randomized image throughout the day.

## Why 3rl?

I built 3rl as a fun and straightforward project to experiment with automation and design... and cause the accounts from Twitter seemed to do well.
